# Project's name

## Description

This application is called Bacardi movies. This application is still under development as it has not been deployed yet. There are still various features missing, and I want to change the app's design, increase the amount of seeded data, and improve some functions. However, the basic functions I wanted to introduce are working perfectly.
The objective of building the application has been achieved, which was to implement a CRUD and ensure that authentications worked

Then, run:
```bash
npm install
```

To start the project run:
```bash
npm run start
```
